1. How LRS HRS LCS and HCS related.
Ans: if mem = LRS memcap is HCS and vice-versa

2. Relation b/w Cm, Cp and Cs.
Ans: Cm = Cs and Cp is in parallel to Cgs. The effective cap is aprox to Cgs.

3. MOSFET parameters : Uo and TPG.

4. How to get potentiaton and depresson curve.

5. How the LRS, HRS (I-V graph) related to potentiaton and depresson curve.

6. What is the length of the transistor described in the task paper. Should we get some transistor model to do the task.
